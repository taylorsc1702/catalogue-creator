# ⚠️ URGENT: Update Your Google Apps Script

You're still getting the error because the Google Apps Script hasn't been updated with the fixed code yet.

## 🔴 Current Error:
```
TypeError: doc.setHeaderMargin is not a function
```

This means the old (broken) code is still running in Google Apps Script.

## ✅ How to Fix (Takes 2 minutes):

### Step 1: Open Your Google Apps Script
1. Go to: https://script.google.com
2. Find your "Catalogue Creator" project
3. Click to open it

### Step 2: Replace ALL the Code
1. **Select ALL the existing code** (Ctrl+A or Cmd+A)
2. **Delete it**
3. **Open the file** `google-apps-script.js` in your IDE (it's already open!)
4. **Copy ALL the code** from that file (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
5. **Paste it** into the Google Apps Script editor (Ctrl+V)

### Step 3: Save
1. **Click the Save icon** (💾) or press Ctrl+S / Cmd+S
2. Wait for "Saved" confirmation

### Step 4: Test
1. Go back to your catalogue creator
2. Click "🚀 Create Google Doc"
3. It should work now!

## 🎯 What Changed?

The fixed code uses the correct Google Apps Script API methods:

**OLD (Broken):**
```javascript
doc.setHeaderMargin(20);  // ❌ This function doesn't exist!
```

**NEW (Fixed):**
```javascript
body.setMarginTop(72);    // ✅ This works!
```

## ⚡ Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Opened Google Apps Script editor
- [ ] Selected and deleted ALL old code
- [ ] Copied ALL code from `google-apps-script.js`
- [ ] Pasted into Google Apps Script editor
- [ ] Saved the script
- [ ] Tested "🚀 Create Google Doc" button

## 📝 Note:

You do NOT need to redeploy! Just save the updated code and it will automatically use the new version. The deployment URL stays the same.

## Still Getting Errors?

If you still see errors after updating:
1. Make sure you copied ALL the code (483 lines)
2. Check that there are no syntax errors in the editor
3. Try refreshing your catalogue creator page
4. Check the "Executions" log in Google Apps Script for detailed errors
